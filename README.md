# Eigenvalue-Regularized Covariance Estimation for Robust Portfolio Construction

This repository contains the Python code that fetches asset return data and implements the simulation-based and empirical analyses conducted for my Master's thesis titled *"Eigenvalue-Regularized Covariance Estimation for Robust Portfolio Construction"*.
The thesis is written as part of the **Master in Banking & Finance** at the **University of St. Gallen**.

Below is an explanation of the repository structure:

## 1. Functions that implement the underlying methodologies, optimization algorithms, illustrations and results:
- `functions.py`

## 2. Simulation-Based Analysis: Table 1, Table 2, Table 9, Figure 6
- `sba.py`

## 3. Empirical Analysis:

### 3.1 Data Generation:
- `oos_data_generation.py`
- `return_data.csv`

### 3.2 Illustrations: Table 3, Figure 1, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5
- `oos_illustrations.py`
- `oos_weight_analysis.py`

### 3.3 Result Generation: Tables 4-8, Tables 10-13
- `oos_results.py`
